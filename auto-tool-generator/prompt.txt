Below I'll provide a cleaned HTML description documentation of an API call and an example of Langchain tool.
This documentation contains description of a specific API call using HTTP protocol. 
It includes HTTP method, URL, description, and parameters.
Use this description to generate a Python code for Langchain LLM Tool Call. Return only Python code without any comments and text from you. Also don't wrap it in "python``````" formatting. I want to copy message you'll return, paste it to empty .py file and run as is.
HTML documentation:
"[api_ref.html]"
An example of already created Langchain tool is:
"[tool_example.py]"
